# Python Code Challenge #3 involving Control Flow
def twice_as_large(num1, num2):
  if num1 > 2*num2:
    return True
  else:
    return False  

# Uncomment these function calls to test your twice_as_large function:
print(twice_as_large(10, 5))
# should print False
print(twice_as_large(11, 5))
# should print True

#I remembered to put operation inside the if statement. I think
the operation ought to have whitespace between each element 
in the expression for best practice. Leaving as is for now.
